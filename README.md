# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Leo

I'm a backend developer passionate about building high-performance, scalable systemsâ€”especially in fast-moving industries like fintech. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve been working on a payment gateway that processes hundreds of requests per second, integrating seamlessly with both internal services and external providers.

My day-to-day revolves around **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and tools like **Docker** and **Google Cloud Platform**. I care deeply about clean architecture, observability, and delivering reliable services through solid CI/CD pipelines and robust infrastructure.

Before switching to tech, I spent 6+ years in multinational companies, working with global engineering and project teams. That experience sharpened my communication, collaboration, and project execution skillsâ€”something I bring into every codebase I contribute to.
