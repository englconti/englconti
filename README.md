- 👋 Hello there, I'm Leo
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack Web development, but my goal is to become a back-end expert in the future. I have a degree in mechanical engineering and project management with 6+ years of experience working in multi-national companies in teams of diverse people. I'm into teamwork and collaborative environments. When solo on projects I enjoy spending time with logical approaches and methods to solve problems. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning <strong>JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, AWS, SQL</strong>. I decided to change careers in 2021 and since then I've been studying and learning new things everyday. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I can actually get my hands dirty with code, logical thinking and teamwork.
